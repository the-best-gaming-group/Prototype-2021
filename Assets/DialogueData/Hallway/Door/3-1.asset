  dialogue:
  - The door was locked, and I looked through the crack in the door.
  - "In the dim light, I glimpsed a shadowy figure, its eyes gleaming with an unnatural\r
    glow, staring at me deeply."
  - My heart pounded in my chest as dread washed over me.
  - "Finally, I took a breath and pretended not to see anything, but the image of\r
    those eerie eyes haunted my thoughts long after."
